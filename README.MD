[![Build and Test](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools.RedumpLib/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools.RedumpLib/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)

This library comprises interaction logic for [Redump](http://redump.org/). Because there is no formal API for the site, this library interacts with the site through normal HTTP methods. It includes a fairly comprehensive reference of supported parts of the site, including URLs, page information, and packs.

Find the link to the Nuget package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SabreTools.RedumpLib).
